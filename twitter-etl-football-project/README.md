### Introduction

Watching the 2022 World Cup made me realize how much of an impact footballers have on people and countries around the whole world. In this project, I will pull data on Ronaldo's, Neymar's and Mbappe's Tweets from the Twitter API and create some visualizations. I have always been a Messi and FC Barcelona fan, but unfortunately Messi does not have a personal Twitter account.

### The Dataset

The data is pulled from the Twitter API.

### Objectives

- Pull data from the Twitter API using Tweepy
- Clean the data
- Create visualizations using Plotly
